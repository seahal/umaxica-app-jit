# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html
#
# Note: This fixture file is intentionally empty to avoid foreign key constraint errors
# during fixture loading. Since fixtures are loaded in alphabetical order, people.yml
# would be loaded before staffs.yml and users.yml, causing FK violations when trying
# to reference non-existent staff and user records.
#
# For testing polymorphic associations with Person, use one of these approaches:
#
# 1. Create Person records dynamically in your tests:
#    staff = staffs(:one)
#    person = staff.people.create!(body: "Test person")
#
# 2. Rename this file to z_people.yml to ensure it loads after other fixtures:
#    This ensures staffs.yml and users.yml are loaded first.
#
# Example test code:
#   test "staff has many people" do
#     staff = staffs(:one)
#     person = staff.people.create!(body: "Staff member profile")
#     assert_equal "Staff", person.personality_type
#     assert_equal staff.id, person.personality_id
#   end

# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# Fixture is intentionally empty. These child table fixtures reference parent records
# that are loaded after them (due to alphabetical fixture loading). This causes
# foreign key constraint violations. Load child records dynamically in tests instead.
#
# Example:
#   staff = staffs(:one)
#   staff.staff_identity_passkeys.create!(description: "key1", external_id: SecureRandom.uuid, public_key: "pk", webauthn_id: SecureRandom.random_bytes(32))

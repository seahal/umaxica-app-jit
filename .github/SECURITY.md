# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest code on the `main` branch. Security fixes are applied to `main` and released as part of normal updates. No long‑term support branches are currently maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please do not open public issues for security reports.
- Submit a private report via GitHub Security Advisories:
  - https://github.com/seahal/umaxica-app-jit/security/advisories/new
- Include a clear description, affected versions/commit, reproduction steps or proof‑of‑concept, and potential impact.

Acknowledgement and timeline:
- We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days and provide a status update within 7 business days.
- Once confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure. We prefer responsible disclosure and may request up to 90 days to remediate depending on complexity.

Out of scope examples:
- Vulnerabilities in third‑party services or dependencies not directly controlled by this repository.
- Best‑practice suggestions without a concrete security impact.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.

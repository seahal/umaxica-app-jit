[] All new controllers have test coverage
[] Integration tests cover cross-domain preference sync
[] Edge cases tested (invalid timezones, malformed cookies, etc.)
[] Run full test suite: bundle exec rails test
[] Run linting: bundle exec rubocop

## API Design Anti-Patterns (AVOID THESE)

### HTTP Status Codes
[] Do NOT return 200 OK for errors - use appropriate status codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors)
[] Ensure error responses use correct HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500, etc.)

### Endpoint Naming
[] Do NOT use RPC-style endpoint names like /getUser, /createUser, /deleteUser
[] Use RESTful conventions: GET /users, POST /users, DELETE /users/{id}
[] Use nouns (resources) not verbs in endpoint paths

### Security
[] Do NOT return passwords in API responses (even hashed)
[] Do NOT return sensitive tokens in responses (use secure cookies or headers)
[] Do NOT pass authentication tokens in query parameters (use headers or secure cookies)
[] Avoid exposing internal IDs or implementation details
[] Ensure all User and Staff DB operations are recorded in Audit logs

### Consistency
[] Do NOT mix naming conventions in the same response (user_id, UserId, idUser)
[] Use consistent casing throughout the API (prefer snake_case for JSON in Rails)
[] Maintain consistent field naming across all endpoints

### Data Types
[] Do NOT return null for collections - return empty arrays [] instead
[] Use appropriate data types (arrays for lists, objects for structured data)
[] Be consistent with null vs empty values

### Error Handling
[] Do NOT return generic error messages like { "error": "Something went wrong" }
[] Provide structured error responses with error codes and detailed messages
[] Include validation errors with field-level details
[] Example good error format:
   ```json
   {
     "errors": [
       {
         "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
         "message": "Invalid email format",
         "field": "email",
         "details": "Email must be a valid email address"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Resource Design
[] Do NOT create ambiguous endpoints like GET /user (singular) and GET /users/{id}
[] Be clear: use GET /users/me for current user, GET /users/{id} for specific user
[] Avoid resource naming conflicts

### Query Parameters
[] Do NOT pass sensitive data in query strings (passwords, tokens, personal data)
[] Use request body for sensitive data in POST/PUT/PATCH requests
[] Keep query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination only

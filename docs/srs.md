# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Project: Umaxica App (JIT)
### Aligned with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 guidance

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
Umaxica App (JIT) replaces the legacy edge-only portal with a unified Ruby on Rails platform that serves every public surface owned by Umaxica—corporate, service, staff, help, docs, news, BFF, and API domains.
The SRS defines the business goals, functional expectations, and quality attributes that the Rails monolith must satisfy while orchestrating user onboarding, customer support, and staff tooling across `umaxica.[app|com|org]` and auxiliary subdomains.

### 1.2 Scope
- Domains in scope (production + regional mirrors):
  - Public sites: `www.umaxica.app`, `www.umaxica.com`, `www.umaxica.org`
  - Service endpoints: `sign.umaxica.*`, `api.jp.umaxica.*`, `docs.[jp|us].umaxica.*`, `help.[jp|us].umaxica.*`, `news.[jp|us].umaxica.*`
  - Staff estate: `www.umaxica.org`, `sign.umaxica.org`, `api.umaxica.org`, etc.
  - Network-only hosts (e.g., `asset-jp.umaxica.net`) are proxied but not powered by Rails.
- Subsystems: top-level marketing pages, authentication (sign), help center/contact flows, documentation and news portals, BFF preference endpoints, public API endpoints for inquiry validation, and supporting infrastructure (Karafka, Kafka, Valkey, OpenTelemetry, MinIO, Fastly/Cloudflare integrations).

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Use
- Product and engineering leadership – prioritization, roadmap alignment
- Domain engineers (Rails/React/Bun) – implementation details and traceable requirements
- DevOps/SRE – hosting, observability, security posture
- QA/Release – acceptance criteria, traceability to tests and documentation

## 3. System Overview
- **Runtime & language**: Ruby 3.4.7 / Rails 8.x monolith with multi-database (`connects_to`) separation (identity, universal, guest, profile, token, etc.) backed by PostgreSQL 18 (primary + replica).
- **Frontend toolchain**: Bun 1.3+ builds Tailwind + React/Turbo entrypoints (`app/javascript`). Assets land in `app/assets/builds` via `bun bun.config.js`.
- **Caching & session adjuncts**: Valkey (Redis-compatible) powers request rate limiting, `Memorize` ephemeral storage, signed preference cookies, and Rack session backing for Action Cable.
- **Messaging & async**: Kafka (via Karafka + WaterDrop) hosts the `email` topic consumed by `EmailConsumer` for OTP and notification fan-out.
- **Security & identity**: JWT auth cookies (ES256) via the `Authn` concern, WebAuthn passkeys, HOTP/TOTP (ROTP), SMS dispatchers (AWS SNS/Infobip/Test), and Cloudflare Turnstile for bot defense.
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation exports to Tempo via OTLP; logs/metrics land in Loki/Grafana (docker/observability stack).
- **Storage & CDN**: Active Storage/Shrine configured for Google Cloud Storage or MinIO (dev). Fastly and Cloudflare R2 provide CDN and asset edge.
- **Surface mapping** (driven by ENV such as `TOP_CORPORATE_URL`, `SIGN_SERVICE_URL`, etc.):
  | Surface | Host examples | Namespace | Responsibilites |
  |---------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
  | Top (marketing / preferences) | `www.umaxica.com`, `www.umaxica.app`, `www.umaxica.org` | `Top::Com/App/Org` | Redirects to edge, exposes `/health`, `/v1/health`, preference UIs (cookie/region/theme). |
  | Sign | `sign.umaxica.app`, `sign.umaxica.org` | `Sign::App/Org` | Registration (email/phone), OTP, passkeys, OAuth (Google/Apple), recovery, withdrawals. |
  | Help | `help.umaxica.com` | `Help::Com/App/Org` | Contact forms, ticket intake (`ServiceSiteContact`), Turnstile enforcement. |
  | Docs / News | `docs.umaxica.*`, `news.umaxica.*` | `Docs::*`, `News::*` | Documentation/newsroom placeholders with health pages. |
  | BFF | `bff.umaxica.*` | `Bff::*` | Non-auth preference/email endpoints for clients. |
  | API | `api.umaxica.*` | `Api::*` | JSON APIs (`/v1/inquiry/valid_email_addresses`, `valid_telephone_numbers`, `health`). |

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Cross-surface routing and platform services
- **FR-01**: Each namespace (`top`, `sign`, `bff`, `api`, `docs`, `news`, `help`) must enforce host-level constraints defined in `config/routes/*.rb` using `ENV` variables to prevent routing leakage.
- **FR-02**: All surfaces implement HTML (`/health`) and JSON (`/v1/health`) heartbeat endpoints via the shared `Health` concern; responses must be cache-friendly and usable by Fastly/Cloudflare monitors.
- **FR-03**: Controllers must set consistent default URL parameters (`lx`, `ri`, `tz`) using `DefaultUrlOptions` so deep links retain localization context.
- **FR-04**: Request throttling is enforced through the `RateLimit` concern (Valkey-backed `rate_limit to: 1000 within 1.hour`) for every ActionController except API health, with overrides for test environments.

### 4.2 Preference management & localization
- **FR-05**: Region/language/timezone updates in `Top::*::Preference::RegionController` must validate against the mappings defined in `PreferenceRegions` and persist to signed cookies (`root_app_preferences`) plus Rails session.
- **FR-06**: Theme selection (`Theme` concern) must support `system/dark/light` with shorthand codes (sy/dr/li) and rewrite to the correct edit URL per scope (Top::App/Com/Org).
- **FR-07**: Cookie consent toggles (`Preference::CookieController` using `Cookie` concern) must respect ePrivacy, storing permanent signed booleans for functional/performance/targeting cookies.

### 4.3 Identity, authentication, and account security (sign.*)
- **FR-08**: Registration flows under `Sign::App::Registration` shall support email signup with Cloudflare Turnstile verification, HOTP issuance (ROTP), and `UserIdentityEmail` persistence using encrypted attributes.
- **FR-09**: Telephone registration controllers mirror email flow but dispatch OTP codes through `AwsSmsService`, which must support AWS SNS, Infobip, and in-memory test providers selected via `Rails.application.config.sms_provider`.
- **FR-10**: Authentication controllers (`Sign::App::Authentication::*`) must issue short-lived access tokens (JWT ES256) and encrypted refresh tokens using `Authn#log_in`. Logout must clear both cookies.
- **FR-11**: Passkey management (`Sign::App::Setting::PasskeysController`) must expose `/setting/passkeys/challenge` and `/verify` endpoints compatible with WebAuthn spec and persist credentials in `UserPasskey`. Passkey-backed sessions always require an enrolled email or telephone identity (no passkey-only login) and may be used both for sign-in after that identity check and as an MFA factor.
- **FR-12**: TOTP provisioning (`Sign::App::Setting::TotpsController`) must generate QR codes (`rqrcode`) with session-stored secrets, verify first token, and persist to `TimeBasedOneTimePassword` (encrypted key).
- **FR-13**: OAuth integrations (Google/Apple) use OmniAuth and must be wired for CSRF-safe flows (move to GET in backlog but tracked here as compliance requirement).
- **FR-14**: Withdrawal controllers must collect user intent and mark accounts for deletion once the `Authn` layer supports revocation.

### 4.4 Support, inquiry, and content surfaces
- **FR-15**: Help center contact forms (`Help::Com::ContactsController`) shall validate input via `ServiceSiteContact`, requiring either email or telephone, policy acceptance, and OTP confirmation. IP addresses must be logged (`ip_address` column) and PII encrypted at rest.
- **FR-16**: Successful contact submissions must enqueue notifications—initially via `Email::App::ContactMailer` (sync) with the ability to offload through the Kafka `email` topic (once `EmailConsumer` wiring is finished).
- **FR-17**: News and Docs namespaces must redirect to content-specific roots and expose health status; they are placeholders for static/dynamic content served through Rails/Turbo (React slots defined in `app/javascript/views`).

### 4.5 API and BFF services
- **FR-18**: Public API endpoints under `Api::App::V1::Inquiry` must provide Base64-safe email validation (`valid_email_addresses#show`) and JSON phone validation (`valid_telephone_numbers#create`) using the same `ServiceSiteContact` validator to avoid duplicating rules.
- **FR-19**: BFF preference endpoints (`Bff::*::Preference::EmailsController`) must reuse `PreferenceRegions` logic while remaining stateless (no session writes) and support locale query aliases (`tz/tz`, `lx/lang`).
- **FR-20**: API/BFF responses must include structured error payloads and standard headers (CORS via `rack-cors`) to enable SPA and mobile clients.

### 4.6 Data protection and compliance
- **FR-21**: Personally identifiable records must reside in their designated database clusters (`IdentitiesRecord`, `GuestsRecord`, `UniversalRecord`, etc.) with `connects_to` wiring honoring read replicas for reporting workloads.
- **FR-22**: Sensitive columns (emails, telephone numbers, OTP secrets) must use Active Record encryption with deterministic mode for lookups where required.
- **FR-23**: Preference cookies (`root_app_preferences`) must be signed/HTTP-only/Lax by default, with same-site exceptions documented if a downstream domain (e.g., `help` forms) legitimately reads them.
- **FR-24**: All database operations (create, update, delete) involving `User` and `Staff` entities must be recorded in the Audit log (`UserIdentityAudit`, `StaffIdentityAudit`) to ensure traceability and accountability.

### 4.7 Observability, CI/CD, and ops readiness
- **FR-24**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation (`config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb`) must be active in production and optionally in development (when OTLP collector is reachable) to push traces to Tempo; spans must include hostnames to differentiate surfaces.
- **FR-25**: Compose stack (PostgreSQL primaries/replicas, Valkey, Kafka, MinIO, Grafana/Loki/Tempo) must stay reproducible for local dev; `Procfile.dev` orchestrates Rails, Bun build watcher, and (optionally) Karafka.
- **FR-26**: GitHub Actions integration pipeline (`integration.yml`) plus Lefthook pre-commit must run `bundle exec rubocop`, `erb_lint`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, `bin/rails test`, and `bun test`.
- **FR-27**: Health dashboards (Grafana) must visualize request rate, OTP/passkey errors, and Kafka lag for the `email` topic.

## 6. Constraints and Dependencies

### 6.1 Technical constraints
- Ruby 3.4.7, Rails 8.x, Bun 1.3+, Node.js 20+ (if needed for tooling), PostgreSQL 18.
- Multi-database config defined in `config/database.yml` requires environment variables for each host (e.g., `POSTGRESQL_IDENTITY_PUB`).
- Asset pipeline relies on Bun + Tailwind CLI; Vite is intentionally not used.
- Dependencies include Karafka, ROTP, WebAuthn, OmniAuth (Google/Apple), Rswag, Pundit, Shrine, SolidCache, Fastly gem, AWS SDK.

### 6.2 Environmental & configuration constraints
- Required ENV keys: host mappings (e.g., `TOP_CORPORATE_URL`, `SIGN_SERVICE_URL`, `API_STAFF_URL`), downstream edge hosts (`EDGE_*`), Redis URLs (`REDIS_RACK_ATTACK_URL`, `REDIS_SESSION_URL`), Cloudflare Turnstile secret, JWT private/public keys, SMS provider selector, storage credentials (GCS/MinIO), OTLP endpoint.
- Docker Compose assumes local ports: Rails 3000 (forwarded to 3001), PostgreSQL primaries on 5435/5436, Valkey on 56379, Kafka 19092, Kafka UI 18080, Grafana 8000, Loki 33100, Tempo 3200/4317, MinIO 9000/9001.
- Foreman/Procfile required for multi-process dev; CI uses GitHub Actions runners with PostgreSQL/Valkey services.

### 6.3 External services & integrations
- Email providers: AWS SES, Resend (future), ActionMailer + SMTP credentials.
- SMS: AWS SNS, Infobip, or custom provider via `AwsSmsService`.
- Cloud providers: Google Cloud (Cloud Run/Build/Storage/Artifact Registry) for deployment, Cloudflare (R2, Turnstile, DNS), Fastly (asset CDN).
- Observability: Tempo/Loki/Grafana stack via Docker; production may forward to managed Grafana Cloud.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Condition |
|----|-----------|
| AC-01 | `GET https://www.umaxica.com/health` returns 200 HTML, `GET .../v1/health` returns JSON `{status:"OK"}` for each host namespace. |
| AC-02 | Editing language/region/timezone/theme updates cookies and redirects back to the proper Top scope with query parameters preserved. |
| AC-03 | Email registration flow issues an OTP via ActionMailer (or Kafka stub) only when Turnstile succeeds and saves `UserIdentityEmail` with encrypted address. |
| AC-04 | Telephone registration rejects invalid E.164 numbers and uses the configured SMS provider. |
| AC-05 | Passkey flow returns creation options, stores the challenge in session, and accepts subsequent verification payloads. |
| AC-06 | Help contact form cannot submit without policy consent; valid submissions persist to `service_site_contacts` and emit a Mailer call. |
| AC-07 | API inquiry endpoints validate addresses/phones using shared rules (no divergent regex). |
| AC-08 | Rate limiting, JWT verification, and Cloudflare Turnstile secrets are configurable per environment and validated during smoke tests. |
| AC-09 | OpenTelemetry traces are visible in Grafana Tempo for at least the top/sign/help flows in staging/production. |
| AC-10 | CI pipeline executes `bundle exec rails test`, `bun test`, `bun run lint`, `rubocop`, `erb_lint`, and `bun run typecheck` before merging. |
